PROBLEM
==========

We want you to write a small application that uses data contained in
the `data` directory to answer the following questions:

1. How many total pounds have all of these athletes combined Bench Pressed?
   Within a given set, reps * weight = total weight
   Ex: 5 reps * 100 pounds = 500 pounds total weight
2. How many total pounds did Barry Moore Back Squat in 2016?
3. In what month of 2017 did Barry Moore Back Squat the most total weight?
4. What is Abby Smith's all-time Bench Press PR weight?
   PR defined as the most the person has ever lifted for that exercise,
   regardless of reps performed.

OUTPUT
==========

Your code should output a JSON object to console when run with the questions above
answered. If you choose to create a web page, React app or other user interface,
please make sure you also provide the requested JSON output. Providing a user interface
is not a requirement. It will not be counted against you if you only provide JSON ouput.

STANDARDS FOR QUALITY
==========

Our engineering teams thrive on quality. At a minimum, we expect your submission to include:

* Correct answers to each question
* A high level of readability
* Consistent formatting with a high level of attention to detail
* Well-named variables, functions, classes, directories, and files
* Clean separation of concerns
* Concern for reusability and deduplication
* Automated testing

The most common ways to fail our code test are to 1) write a procedural
program that can only be used to answer the specific questions asked and
2) have all code contained in a single file. While this approach may be
fast to develop and does demonstrate basic programming capability, it
rarely reflects a production quality implementation.

SUBMISSION
==========

If you have any questions on the code or what is being asked,
please don't hesitate to email.

Please submit your completed test to a private github repo and invite
the and invite the hiring manager â€“ username provided by your Peaksware
Talent Acquisition contact.

We expect this test to take you around 2 hours.

We are continually looking for ways to improve our process, so feel free to give us feedback.
